# Earth Engine Web Application Demo

This is the code for a tutorial series named Accessing Earth Engine Data in Web Applications. The video series can be found in this [YouTube play list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJUish92E8&list=PL6MV53L4XD09fk3xvbDN468Pc8eQLVWxQ)

The series steps through the process of setting up a development environment where you will have two main code bases, a server-side code that will communicate directly with Earth Engine, and a client-side code that will communicate with the server-side code to pass parameters then properly display the results in the UI.

In the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJUish92E8&) you will learn how to setup your the server-side and client side environments. We will do a quick test to confirm that it is working. In the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM62xqGX-nk) we will build out a test route which will return a tile url for a pre-defined earth engine image, and then display it on a map. Our [thrid video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADV-P5OQbw) will create a dynamic UI framework to request datasets from earth engine. We will add a new route called meanImageByCollection which will enable us to request any EE image collection, filter by date, and apply vision parameters. In [video number four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuU5KZm6A-s) we will continue to expand the reusable framework to include graphing.
